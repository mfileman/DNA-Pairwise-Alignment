# DNA-Pairwise-Alignment
This was a project for my bioinformatics class. We studied a dynamic programming algorithm (&amp; backtracking) for finding the most optimum pairwise alignment between two DNA sequences. This is that algorithm and backtracking to find one &amp; then all the optimum alignments of two sequences (accepted in .fasta format). Implemented in swift.
